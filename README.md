Redirects users to https://www.goodolminecraft.net

Because of the weird way Google Sites works, I can have a Google Site hosted on a subdomain, including a www subdomain, but it cannot be hosted on the main domain. Github Pages does allow hosting on the main domain, so I have this repo set up as a redirect from the main domain to the www subdomain.
